## Hi!! ðŸ‘‹

![cinnamoroll on a computer!](https://p-bandai.com/img/sg/p/m/N2431829001001_019.jpg)

I'm Anabel, a GIT major! *(graphic information technology)*. I'm learning HTML as part of my pathway to web design, and then maybe even more advanced coding! Someday, I would really like to contribute towards making a game somehow. Right now, I'm still just learning HTML and CSS, but I hope that I can achieve my dream of making something for others that will stick with them in their memories, preferably in the game medium.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸
